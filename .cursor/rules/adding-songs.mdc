# Adding Songs to Groovulator

Quick reference for adding new songs to artist catalogs on the Groovulator site.

## File Locations

- **Songs data**: `/src/app/{artist}/songs/songs.ts` (e.g., `/src/app/theverybaddays/songs/songs.ts`)
- **Track art**: `/public/images/{artist}/songs/{song-id}/`
- **Required images**: `track-art-256.jpg`, `track-art-512.jpg`, `track-art-1024.jpg`

## Song Object Structure

```typescript
{
  id: "song-title-kebab-case",           // Must match track art directory name
  title: "Song Title",
  description: "Can include <a> tags",   // HTML links allowed
  spotifyId: "TBD",                      // Use "TBD" until published
  releaseDate: "YYYY-MM-DD",             // Future dates show countdown
  songType: "single" | "track",          // "track" for album songs
  appleMusicLink: "",                    // Empty string placeholder, fill when available
  amazonMusicLink: "",                   // Empty string placeholder, fill when available
  youtubeLink: "",                       // Empty string placeholder, fill when available
  youtubeMusicLink: "",                  // Empty string placeholder, fill when available
  
  lyrics: `#### Verse 1
First line
Second line

#### Chorus
Chorus line`,                            // Use #### for section headers
  
  credits: "Line one\nLine two\nLine three", // Use \n for line breaks
  
  // For album tracks only
  album: "Album Name",
  albumLink: "https://open.spotify.com/album/...",
  trackList: 1,                          // Track number
}
```

## Process Checklist

1. **Verify track art** is in `/public/images/{artist}/songs/{song-id}/`
2. **Add song entry** to appropriate songs array (usually at top for new singles)
3. **Format lyrics** with `#### ` headers for sections
4. **Format credits** with `\n` for line breaks  
5. **Use "TBD"** for spotifyId if not yet available
6. **Add placeholder links** - Include empty string `""` for all streaming platforms
7. **Run build** with `npm run build` to verify
8. **Test song page** at `https://{artist}.com/songs/{song-id}`

## Future Releases

- Release dates in the future automatically show countdown timer
- Add `?debug=true` to URL to preview streaming links before release
- Update spotifyId and streaming links when song is published

## Common Mistakes

❌ Using actual line breaks in credits string → ✅ Use `\n`  
❌ Using `#` or `##` for lyrics → ✅ Use `####` for section headers  
❌ Missing spotifyId → ✅ Always include, use "TBD" if needed  
❌ Song ID doesn't match directory → ✅ Must be exact match
