    description: "We made a playlist for when those Halloween Bone skeletons come by! When there are not Halloween Bone skeletons, you can listen anyway. But be sure to listen especially when there ARE Halloween Bone skeletons. It's full of our favorite Halloween songs that nobody talks about, except us and our bands and our friends' bands, and now you. The songs are good, and they are spooky, and they are songtastically delicious. You can listen. You can add them to your playlists. You can get haunted, but in a fun, maybe sexy way. Thank you for letting the Halloween Bone skeletons into your ears.",
