      "A haunted pep talk in lo-fi drag, Spooky Song loops like a dusty cassette in the glovebox of a ghost's car. There's grit in the groove and weight in the words. Rhymes for the lonely, rhythms for the freaks. It's a funeral march you can dance to, with a bassline that drags its bones across the floor and a chorus that chants like a séance in your parents' basement.\n\nSad kids, weird hearts, strange rhythms. You're not alone. Just spooky.",

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
Hard living when you don't belong with them.
That's why you need a sad song with a good rhythm.
Like a shovel in a cemetery, digging grooves for

the souls of the people who once had bones
before they gave up their ghosts to the sticks and the stones.
You're digging deeper cuz it's hard to rise above.

#### Prechorus
You know, if you're gonna stay here,
you're gonna have to love yourself somehow.
And damn, that's spooky.

#### Chorus
Li li li li
Everybody's gotta…
Li li li li
Everybody's gonna be at the party on Saturday
You gonna be all by yourself
Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones

#### Verse 2
Hard breathing when you don't believe in it.
That's why you let yourself freeze for a good minute
before you open your lungs and pull in the breeze.

There's no one here who can tell you to leave.
You're a part of the smell of the rain and the wind in the trees.
So hard to forgive and forget when there's tightness in your chest.

#### Prechorus
When you know you don't have to stay here.
You don't have to love yourself anymore.
And damn, that's spooky.

#### Chorus
Li li li li
Everybody's gotta…
Li li li li
Everybody's gonna be at the party on Saturday
You gonna be all by yourself
Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones

#### Chorus
Li li li li
Everybody's gotta…
Li li li li
Everybody knows if you're gonna stay here
You're gonna have to give your love sometimes
Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones

#### Chorus... again
Li li li li
Everybody's gotta…
Li li li li
Everybody's gonna be at the party on Saturday
You never have to be all by yourself
Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones`,

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
There's a dread about the mountains
and the Appalachian night.
In the middle of a dreamless sleep
you waken in a fright

There's an eerie feeling in the air.
You can feel it everywhere,
up from your toes, up to the hair
that's standing on your neck.

And there's whispering in the forest, if you listen very hard.
There's goblins in Kentucky and they're playing in the yard.

#### Chorus
Don't take my love away, don't take my children, too!
You fearsome goblins of Kentucky, oh, just what you gonna do to us?
There's a light coming from the woods
out back by the old well

#### Verse 2
You suddenly remember all the stories from your youth
that come drifting back to you upon the breeze;
The glowing people from the caves below
that come creeping through the trees.

You're sweating in the humid night,
but you feel a chill, you see a light
outside, getting closer, shining bright.
And suddenly it's at the window!

There's scratching at the window and there's footprints in the grass.
There's goblins in Kentucky and they're looking through the glass.

#### Chorus
Don't take my love away, don't take m-my children, too!
Y-you fearsome goblins of Kentucky, oh, what are you gonna do to us?
There's a light coming from the woods
out back by the old well!
There's a face peeking in the window!
Don't look, baby, don't look!

#### Verse 3
Grab your gun and rush your family to the basement,
where you're safe and you can wait until they leave.
They're all around the house now, climbing up the walls
and skittering across the roof and hanging down from the eaves.

A heavy silence settles in.
You feel it crawling up your skin
like spiders, alien and thin.
Your frantic mind begins to spin.

You're haunted by their bug-eyed peeking,
spindly fingernail squeaking.
You're shivering, dark and dank and bleak.
That's when the floorboards start to creak above you

You believe in Jesus, not in ghouls or luck or gnomes
But there's goblins in Kentucky and they've gotten in your home.

#### Chorus
They took m-my love away, they took m-my children, too!
Oh great g-g-gods here in Kentucky, oh, what have I done to you?
Oh, there's a light coming from the woods
out back by the old well!
There's a face peeking in the window!
Don't scream, baby, hush now!`,

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
Took a trip today
Don't know how long we're gone
We put our hearts on the radio
and we gave in to the song

I came so close to nothing, you were all that remained,
like a warm point of light in the dark
your love had found me and it wrapped itself around me
and I know I'm going home again.

#### Chorus
Into the Beautiful Unknown we go,
just hold me close til the morning.
As we drift away, I'll take your hand,
lead me into the night

and to the Universe below, I know,
I'm not myself anymore, no.
If the sun comes up tomorrow,
I know you'll wait for me in the light.

#### Verse 2
We got back in the morning
Don't know how long we stayed.
It's so shockingly quiet
when the music stops playing.

When we look up to the heavens we're not praying.
We're just looking for what I found in your arms.

There's no Heaven above us, but there's surely a Hell below
me if I should ever fail to tell you that I love you.

#### Chorus
Into the Beautiful Unknown we go,
just don't let go til the morning.
As we drift away, I trust you
—just you— take me into the night.

With the Universe below aglow,
I'm not myself anymore, no.
When the sun comes up tomorrow,
I know you'll be waiting.`,

I saw Mothman in the sky

I was feeling pretty rough cuz I got too high

Late at night one Saturday
On the bridge I built from yesterday
He flew with me a little way
Then he swoop real low and I hear him say

#### Chorus
What did he tell me?
I'm the Mothman
Burn ya bridges baby

#### Verse 3
I saw Mothman in my sleep
He spoke to me like a father
Said, Son, these waters mighty deep
And this bridge you're on look pretty weak

#### Chorus
What did he tell me?
I'm the Mothman
Big spooky lamp-lover

#### Bridge
I believe in the Mothman
And he believes in me

#### Verse 4
I saw Mothman in the sky
Great big wings, deep red eyes
No one knows til the day they die
Just where the Mothman flies`,

It drifts like smoke through the trees, telling the story of a man searching for something unreal and finding something even rarer.

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
Are you out there?
Asked the cryptozoologist
In the woods behind his trailer
to the silence.

What's the point of all this
Searching in the brush
If what I'm looking for is something
That's beyond the reach of science?

#### Chorus
And I've never ever seen a single shred of evidence to tell me what I wanna know –
There is someone out there and that I am not alone.

#### Verse 2
Can you hear me?
Cried the cryptozoologist
To the laughter of the people
That he yearned for

It was then he heard
The snapping of his trap
That had just captured up the very legendary
Creature he'd been spurned for

#### Pre-Chorus
And his mind began to race with all fame that he would find
He could almost hear the fearful cheers of the people who would get in line for his

#### Chorus
Cryptid carnival –
Where everybody loves me and I'll never be alone

#### Bridge
The creature gave out a blood-curdling cry
Under matted black hair, covered in flies
The hunter leaned in to look upon his prize
But he knew from the glowing green eyes
Of the creature he had searched for all his life
That the most incredible cryptid would always be inside

#### Verse 3
I can't believe
That I have found you, cried the man
to the beast before he
Freed it from the snare

I think the mystery
Is lovelier than knowing
What awaits us in the darkness
That we share with one another

And I never ever thought I'd be so close to something great and then I'd have to let it go
Cuz if there is something out there, I don't have to feel alone.`,
