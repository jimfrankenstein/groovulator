      "A hazy, late-night drive through the wreckage of a bad trip, where the universe warps, the music cuts out, and the only thing keeping you from floating off into the abyss is the one person who won't let you slip. It's a love song for the lost and found... one foot in the void, one hand in theirs.",

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
Took a trip today
Don't know how long we're gone
We put our hearts on the radio
and we gave in to the song

I came so close to nothing, you were all that remained,
like a warm point of light in the dark
your love had found me and it wrapped itself around me
and I know I'm going home again.

#### Chorus
Into the Beautiful Unknown we go,
just hold me close til the morning.
As we drift away, I'll take your hand,
lead me into the night

and to the Universe below, I know,
I'm not myself anymore, no.
If the sun comes up tomorrow,
I know you'll wait for me in the light.

#### Verse 2
We got back in the morning
Don't know how long we stayed.
It's so shockingly quiet
when the music stops playing.

When we look up to the heavens we're not praying.
We're just looking for what I found in your arms.

There's no Heaven above us, but there's surely a Hell below
me if I should ever fail to tell you that I love you.

#### Chorus
Into the Beautiful Unknown we go,
just don't let go til the morning.
As we drift away, I trust you
—just you— take me into the night.

With the Universe below aglow,
I'm not myself anymore, no.
When the sun comes up tomorrow,
I know you'll be waiting.`,

      "Here There Be Monsters slithers in like a half-remembered nightmare from a crooked carnival, equal parts spectacle and warning. Twisted melodies sway on a tightrope above chaos, while the lyrics mutter folklore through a cracked megaphone. It's the kind of song that feels like it's watching you back, grinning through sharpened teeth and beckoning you just a little deeper into the woods.",

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
Welcome, dear traveler, fearful, alone
Although welcomes are meaningless, strange, and unknown
In this terrible place. The look on your face
Says you're rather put off by this desolate waste

The mothers and kids have abandoned their homes
For the ivy is worming its way through the bones
Of the fathers that fought and then came to not
At betentacled limbs. Bemoan them with hymns that say

#### Chorus
Here there be monsters
And there there, my dear, we all die
And this town is a frightening place
So watch your step and hold your breath
Because here there be monsters

#### Verse 2
In the dark of the woods, by the light of the eyes
Of the peekers that peek and the criers that cry
Hear the claws of the clickers that clack on the trees
To the quickening beat of your heart and your pleas

They'll crack in your head and they'll crawl in your mind
And they'll pull out the sinew and sins that they find
Twist them around like hideous crowns
And wear them like robes, and nobody knows why, but

#### Chorus

#### Verse 3
Why are you listening still to our song
While these monsters advance in their devilish throng
There's one at your toes that's beginning to eat
While you stand there quite foolishly tapping your feet

High tail and run for it, straight through the morning
Yea, that is the gist of this melodic warning:
A horrible death does await if you stay
So run away, far away, go away, by the way…

I saw Mothman in the sky
He had great big wings and some deep red eyes
And coincidentally, so did I
I was feeling pretty rough cuz I got too high

#### Verse 2
Late at night one Saturday
On the bridge I built from yesterday
He flew with me a little way
Then he swoop real low and I hear him say

#### Chorus
What did he tell me?
I'm the Mothman
Burn ya bridges baby

#### Verse 3
I saw Mothman in my sleep
He spoke to me like a father
Said, Son, these waters mighty deep
And this bridge you're on look pretty weak

#### Chorus
What did he tell me?
I'm the Mothman
Big spooky lamp-lover

#### Bridge
I believe in the Mothman
And he believes in me

#### Verse 4
I saw Mothman in the sky
Great big wings, deep red eyes
No one knows til the day they die
Just where the Mothman flies`,

      "A haunted pep talk in lo-fi drag, Spooky Song loops like a dusty cassette in the glovebox of a ghost's car. There's grit in the groove and weight in the words. Rhymes for the lonely, rhythms for the freaks. It's a funeral march you can dance to, with a bassline that drags its bones across the floor and a chorus that chants like a séance in your parents' basement.\n\nSad kids, weird hearts, strange rhythms. You're not alone. Just spooky.",

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
Hard living when you don't belong with them.
That's why you need a sad song with a good rhythm.
Like a shovel in a cemetery, digging grooves for

the souls of the people who once had bones
before they gave up their ghosts to the sticks and the stones.
You're digging deeper cuz it's hard to rise above.

#### Prechorus
You know, if you're gonna stay here,
you're gonna have to love yourself somehow.
And damn, that's spooky.

#### Chorus
Li li li li
Everybody's gotta…
Li li li li
Everybody's gonna be at the party on Saturday
You gonna be all by yourself
Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones

#### Verse 2
Hard breathing when you don't believe in it.
That's why you let yourself freeze for a good minute
before you open your lungs and pull in the breeze.

There's no one here who can tell you to leave.
You're a part of the smell of the rain and the wind in the trees.
So hard to forgive and forget when there's tightness in your chest.

#### Prechorus
When you know you don't have to stay here.
You don't have to love yourself anymore.
And damn, that's spooky.

#### Chorus
Li li li li
Everybody's gotta…
Li li li li
Everybody's gonna be at the party on Saturday
You gonna be all by yourself
Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones

#### Chorus
Li li li li
Everybody's gotta…
Li li li li
Everybody knows if you're gonna stay here
You're gonna have to give your love sometimes
Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones

#### Chorus... again
Li li li li
Everybody's gotta…
Li li li li
Everybody's gonna be at the party on Saturday
You never have to be all by yourself
Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones`,

    description:
      "A hushed, heart-heavy folk tale plucked from the underbrush on a weathered tenor guitar. It drifts like smoke through the trees, telling the story of a man searching for something unreal and finding something even rarer. Part campfire myth, part confession, it's a quiet hymn for the outcasts, the seekers, and anyone who's ever longed to be known by something stranger than themselves.",

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
Are you out there?
Asked the cryptozoologist
In the woods behind his trailer
to the silence.

What's the point of all this
Searching in the brush
If what I'm looking for is something
That's beyond the reach of science?

#### Chorus
And I've never ever seen a single shred of evidence to tell me what I wanna know –
There is someone out there and that I am not alone.

#### Verse 2
Can you hear me?
Cried the cryptozoologist
To the laughter of the people
That he yearned for

It was then he heard
The snapping of his trap
That had just captured up the very legendary
Creature he'd been spurned for

#### Pre-Chorus
And his mind began to race with all fame that he would find
He could almost hear the fearful cheers of the people who would get in line for his

#### Chorus
Cryptid carnival –
Where everybody loves me and I'll never be alone

#### Bridge
The creature gave out a blood-curdling cry
Under matted black hair, covered in flies
The hunter leaned in to look upon his prize
But he knew from the glowing green eyes
Of the creature he had searched for all his life
That the most incredible cryptid would always be inside

#### Verse 3
I can't believe
That I have found you, cried the man
to the beast before he
Freed it from the snare

I think the mystery
Is lovelier than knowing
What awaits us in the darkness
That we share with one another

And I never ever thought I'd be so close to something great and then I'd have to let it go
Cuz if there is something out there, I don't have to feel alone.`,
