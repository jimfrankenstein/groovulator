    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
She woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
Another day, another undetermined end.
All's well that ends well, but the in-betweens are enough
to make you feel that enough is enough.

#### Verse 2
The kids won't blame you, they know times is tough,
and nobody will deny you've had it rough.
Tie white boots over jumpsuit, bright yellow as the sun.
Grab keys, heavy sigh, and a short walk to the van.

#### Prechorus
April, you keep thinking that your life is in the toilet;
well, baby, you should know it's in the sewers.

#### Chorus 1
April, keep your wits about you, April, it's not hard.
This King of Rats won't stand a chance with this Turtle Force in your backyard.
April, keep your wits about you, April, don't be meek.
This Green Machine will keep your jumper clean of absurdities week to week.

#### Verse 3
It's tough to live when your life's an open cell,
free to wander through your private jail.
Through episode after episode, I only hope you learn
some tricks to help you come out of your shell.

#### Chorus 2
April, keep your wits about you, April, you're not dumb.
And everyone here understands that fame is not just something that comes
up to rescue you from a subway or an alien invasion.
April, keep that camera rolling and I'll tell you what I'm saying.

#### Bridge
Someday, maybe you can find yourself
in another world, another series of events.
Maybe score a cushy job as a lab assistant?
Change lives one sequence at a time.

But your past will always follow you, and you will stay the same.
Maybe your jock boyfriend will make it worth it.

#### Verse 4
Just know that you've got nothing left to prove,
and dammit, there ain't nothing you can't do.
It seems the world's against you, but you'll land on your feet.
Now grab a slice, here's looking at you.

#### Chorus 3
April, keep your wits about you, April, don't give up.
Sure, you spend your days in a laser cage, but you still get your stories done.
April, keep your wits about you, tomorrow's a brand new day.
New origins await you, in the city by the bay.`,

It shadowy figures
That you're in this place
Fallen from Grace
An upside down face

The south wall is open 
The Unsound is calling
But you keep on falling
One, two, three, four, five, six six six

#### Chorus
This is what you get when you walk through the Devil's Door
One, two, three, four, five, six six six`,

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
I was thinking the other day:
Why do good men die? Why do criminals get away?
Why do they nail down a coffin lid anyway?
Because of zombies.

If it's a secret, then where is the King?
What crashed at Roswell and made it a thing?
Why is there a French fry in my onion rings?
Conspiracy.

#### Verse 2
Do you think that if I told it,
you would have the power to control it?
You can't have everything; how would you hold it?
And furthermore…

Only scientists can tell us:
who builds robots so rebellious?
No use hiding, they can smell us.

#### Verse 3
Will the rains take our lives?
When the flood waters come, will the wicked survives?
Did Noah keep bees in his ark hives?
I submit that he did.

In the event the protagonist dies,
who will be the hero when the villains arrive?
The one who saves the city will get a surprise!
You think it's bees?

I think it's bees.`,

Welcome, dear traveler, fearful, alone
Although welcomes are meaningless, strange, and unknown
In this terrible place. The look on your face
Says you're rather put off by this desolate waste

The mothers and kids have abandoned their homes
For the ivy is worming its way through the bones
Of the fathers that fought and then came to not
At betentacled limbs. Bemoan them with hymns that say

#### Chorus
Here there be monsters
And there there, my dear, we all die
And this town is a frightening place
So watch your step and hold your breath
Because here there be monsters

#### Verse 2
In the dark of the woods, by the light of the eyes
Of the peekers that peek and the criers that cry
Hear the claws of the clickers that clack on the trees
To the quickening beat of your heart and your pleas

They'll crack in your head and they'll crawl in your mind
And they'll pull out the sinew and sins that they find
Twist them around like hideous crowns
And wear them like robes, and nobody knows why, but

#### Chorus

#### Verse 3
Why are you listening still to our song
While these monsters advance in their devilish throng
There's one at your toes that's beginning to eat
While you stand there quite foolishly tapping your feet

High tail and run for it, straight through the morning
Yea, that is the gist of this melodic warning:
A horrible death does await if you stay
So run away, far away, go away, by the way…

    lyrics: `#### Part 1
Do you remember that summer that we spent out on the lake?
We were young, and our whole family was staying with Aunt Mildred.
Nobody really noticed her warm eyes and solemn smile,
but I took to her quite fondly. And she showed me all around her brand new house
that our father built upon the ashes of the old family estate
that he had recently acquired.

#### Part 2
Aunt Mildred showed me how to use the oven, and I'd bake
these little treats for all her cats and dogs, and chase them through the hallways.
And father would light a cigarette and stand out in the tide,
and watch the sun go down, and listen to the waves come rolling in.
Because he didn't like the songs that she would sing to him when it got late
and the house smelled like tobacco.

#### Part 3
And they'd have buried Aunt Mildred if she hadn't burned up
inside the house with all her animals and her crazy little knick knacks.
And the bones that they could find, they put inside a sealed box,
laid to rest in the foundation of the grand, marvelous tribute of a house
that our father built upon the ashes of the old family estate
that he had recently acquired.

#### Part 4
Then came the day; I heard old Mildred singing sweetly by the water's edge.
So I went outside to listen while the gas flowed freely from the oven I left on.
I watched the house go up, and I listened to our father screaming out
as Aunt Mildred smiled out the doorway of the old family estate
that I would soon come to acquire.`,

We all know the attention monkeys bring, so where the hell will all these monkeys stay the night?

Hail, hail to the Monkey King!
Hail, hail to the Chief!
No one will remember you, but that's the way you wanted it to be.
So just be free and you'll see that everyone's afraid of being seen.

#### Verse 2
Just an eon and a century ago, all you needed was some time to be alone.
And everybody that we loved would be at home, waiting for us.
Then a couple hundred million years went by and you decided there were too many prying eyes.
And thus, rebelliously charged into Oblivion upon a stegosaurus.

Hail, hail to the Monkey King!
Hail, hail to the Butcher of the Dinosaurs!
No one will remember you, but that's the way you wanted it to be.
So just be free, and you'll see that everyone's afraid of being seen.

Hail, hail to the Monkey King!
Hail, hail to the god who left us long ago!
No one will remember you, but that's the way we needed it to be.
We'll just be free and we'll see that everyone's alone and wants to feel
connected to the world around them.`,

where you live on in the beat eternally.

Leave your soul deep down in the dirt
and join the skeletons forevermore.

Submitted for the approval of The Very Bad Society,
we call this dreadful story the Tale of the Woodman!

#### Verse 1
Long ago, Camp Woodman was a peaceful summer haven
for the children, but one counselor saw visions in his head.
The counselor sold his soul to win the annual Camp Woodman Days;
a fateful sack race later and the children all were dead.

#### Chorus
Go, go Woodman, go!
Was it worth it to win the first prize?
Run, run children, run!
It's the Horrible Legend of Woodman!

#### Verse 2
The counselor's soul was banished to the waters of Lake Woodman
and his dead and rotting body was entombed beneath the waves.
But with his evil, dying breath, he swore that he'd return one day,
and now waits for the day when he will rise up from the grave!

#### Chorus
Go, go Woodman, go!
It is time for the Woodman to rise!
Run, run children, run!
It's the Soggy Old Legend of Woodman!

#### Bridge
Woodman was erected by some kids around a campfire,
singing hymns, reciting chants to give the Woodman breath.
Foolish children, who art thee to raise the mighty Woodman?
Don't you fear the splintered curses of the Evil Wooden Death?

#### Verse 3
Woodman was descended from the Antichrist Beelzebub
to punish all the campers who would wander off alone.
But Little Boris found the ancient Tome, Arbor Daemonium
and said the Blessed Chant that burned the wooden man to bone!

#### Chorus
Go, go Woodman, go!
You have summoned your wooden demise!
Run, run children, run!
It's the Abomination, He is Woodman!

Go, Little Boris, go!
In fire, the Woodman, he dies!
Run, run children, run!
It's the Horrible Legend of Woodman!`,

to drink your wine and soothe your aching soul.

Unhappy Kathy,
as your breath grows thin,
surrendering now to the hope
that you'll find comfort in the
weight that lifts your heart and lets you go.`,

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
There's a road we walked down I swore I'd never go down without you.
And there's a place in Uptown I go to when I'm thinking about you.
Our old haunt, our one detente after the bullshit: Beer, laughs, and caffeine.
Now I'm stumbling down Lake Street looking for your ghost in these memories.

#### Prechorus
On this Minnesota night,
alone and drunk beneath the city lights,
your transcendent memory is warming up my soul.

#### Verse 2
There's a coffee shop on 26th and Lynd that we walked to.
We spent hours there, over alcohol and caffeination, I fell for you.
Your dark hair was curling down from a white knit cap to your shoulders.
We made handprints in the frosted over glass as I got bolder,

#### Prechorus
and on that Minnesota night,
alone and drunk beneath the city lights,
your transcendent kiss was warming up my soul.
And I was thinking that

#### Chorus
you're the one I wanna be with,
you're the girl I think I wanna drag into this
cogent argument for a life.
Porters, lagers, coffee ales.

#### Bridge
Now you're gone, and God knows it is colder than ever
(and it's just November).
And all of these streets seem so empty.
I just can't explain it, but

#### Prechorus
on this Minnesota night,
alone and drunk beneath the city lights,
I can feel your soul and it's warming up my bones.

#### Chorus
You're the one I wanna be with,
you're the girl I think I wanna drag into this
cogent argument for a life.
Porters, lagers, coffee ales.`,

    lyrics: `#### Verse 1
Socrates was just a boy when he discovered dialectics
and aesthetics was a part of his genetics as he paved the way for modern thought.
Why is there something at all when nothing it could also be?
I don't know. But it's better than not.

But here below the Cogito, where the ego flows into the Void,
we argued over insidious intent and oyster shells.
But when I made you laugh I learned what nothing can achieve
when it just be.

#### Chorus
And logically it seems that it's really gotta make you think
when I go like this.

#### Verse 2
Nietzsche was just a man, yet he slayeth the tyrant god.
And if God can't keep itself alive, who can?
Dante Alighieri found the Way was very scary
and he gave up. Long before it all began,

you sang a hymn, you made it grim, you let a little skin peek out your habit,
and I fell into the Hell that is your
apoca-lips against my own, I felt a little soul
inside my bones.

#### Chorus
And like the pagans know, it's really gonna due your devil
when I go like this.

#### Bridge
Sometimes when we're alone together
I can feel the dreadful rhythm of love coming out your body
with every beat of your heart.

It's pounding all the dust out of your hair
and raining down like skin cells on your cheek.
I freak out a little when I think about it.

#### Chorus
That's what I'm trying to say.`,
